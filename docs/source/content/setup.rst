To get started, you need `TOKEN` and `PHONE_ID` from the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).
You can get these by following the steps below:

1. Create a new app on the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/create/). Select Business >> Business.
2. Enter basic app information when prompted.
3. Add `WhatsApp Messenger` as a product for your app.
4. If you just want to test, go to `API Setup` (under `Products` in the sidebar) and copy the `Temporary access token` and the `Phone number ID`
   - Note: The temporary access token expires after 24 hours. You can generate a new one by clicking on `Generate new token` under `API Setup`.
   - Note: In test mode you can only send messages up to 5 phone numbers. You can add phone numbers to the list by clicking on `To` >> `Manage phone numbers list` under `API Setup`.
5. If you want to go live, go to `API Setup` (under `Products` in the sidebar) and click on `Add phone number`. Fill in the required details and submit the form. You will receive a confirmation email once your request is approved.
