In WhatsApp Cloud API, updates are sent to your webhook URL. There are lots of different types of updates,
but currently, we only support the ``messages`` field. this field contains all the user-related updates (e.g. messages, callbacks, etc.).

.. note::
    :class: dropdown

    The ``messages`` field must be enabled in your webhook settings. Otherwise, you will not receive any updates.
    To enable it, go to your app dashboard, click on the ``Webhooks`` tab. Then, subscribe to the ``messages`` field.
